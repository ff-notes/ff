note_text: "repeating tasks\n\n`done` moves to future in fixed period; may be useful
  for utility payments, or for other regular routines.\r\n\r\nThis is how org-mode
  handles repeated tasks:\r\n\r\n> With the ‘+1m’ cookie, the date shift is always
  exactly one month. So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
  entry DONE still keeps it as an overdue deadline. Depending on the task, this may
  not be the best way to handle it. For example, if you forgot to call your father
  for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call him 3 times in a single day to make
  up for it. Finally, there are tasks like changing batteries which should always
  repeat a certain time after the last time you did it. For these tasks, Org mode
  has special repeaters ‘++’ and ‘.+’. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n** TODO Call Father\r\n
  \  DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>\r\n   Marking this DONE shifts the date by at
  least one week, but also\r\n   by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
  the future.\r\n   However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called and marked it\r\n
  \  done on Saturday.\r\n\r\n** TODO Empty kitchen trash\r\n   DEADLINE: <2008-02-08
  Fri 20:00 ++1d>\r\n   Marking this DONE shifts the date by at least one day, and
  also\r\n   by as many days as it takes to get the timestamp into the future.\r\n
  \  Since there is a time in the timestamp, the next deadline in the\r\n   future
  will be on today's date if you complete the task before\r\n   20:00.\r\n\r\n** TODO
  Check the batteries in the smoke detectors\r\n   DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>\r\n
  \  Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after today.\r\n```"
