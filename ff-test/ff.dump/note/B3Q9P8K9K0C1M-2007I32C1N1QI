  note_text: "repeating tasks\n\n`done` moves to future in fixed period; may be useful
    for utility payments, or for other regular routines.\r\n\r\nThis is how org-mode
    handles repeated tasks:\r\n\r\n> With the ‘+1m’ cookie, the date shift is always
    exactly one month. So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking
    this entry DONE still keeps it as an overdue deadline. Depending on the task,
    this may not be the best way to handle it. For example, if you forgot to call
    your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call him 3 times in a single
    day to make up for it. Finally, there are tasks like changing batteries which
    should always repeat a certain time after the last time you did it. For these
    tasks, Org mode has special repeaters ‘++’ and ‘.+’. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**
    TODO Call Father\r\n   DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>\r\n   Marking this DONE
    shifts the date by at least one week, but also\r\n   by as many weeks as it takes
    to get this date into the future.\r\n   However, it stays on a Sunday, even if
    you called and marked it\r\n   done on Saturday.\r\n\r\n** TODO Empty kitchen
    trash\r\n   DEADLINE: <2008-02-08 Fri 20:00 ++1d>\r\n   Marking this DONE shifts
    the date by at least one day, and also\r\n   by as many days as it takes to get
    the timestamp into the future.\r\n   Since there is a time in the timestamp, the
    next deadline in the\r\n   future will be on today's date if you complete the
    task before\r\n   20:00.\r\n\r\n** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors\r\n
    \  DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>\r\n   Marking this DONE will shift the date
    to one month after today.\r\n```"
