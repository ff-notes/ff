note_text: "Add optional time to dates\n\n# Probable solution:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\n--
  | Day and Maybe Time\r\ntype DMT = Either Day UTCTime\r\n```\r\nDay is treated in
  current time zone, UTCTime is UTC\r\n\r\n# With timezone\r\n\r\n> use a string.
  Specifically, use the full qualified name in the Olson database, so something like
  Australia/Adelaide or America/Los_Angeles. These are standardized descriptors of
  the timezones used in the world, and you can use these in pretty much every programming
  language ever used in the last few decades.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\r\n\r\nhttps://zachholman.com/talk/utc-is-enough-for-everyone-right"
