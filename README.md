# 𝑓𝑓

A distributed note taker and task manager.

## What's the big deal?

1.  𝑓𝑓 synchronizes via any file sync application, like git, Yandex.Disk,
    Dropbox, or Google Drive.
2.  𝑓𝑓 is available offline and synchronizes without conflicts thanks to
    [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)
    and [RON](http://replicated.cc).

## Stability

Works on all my computers and synchronizes between them successfully.
𝑓𝑓's own issues are tracked in 𝑓𝑓 since the first day of development.
I also use 𝑓𝑓 for my personal tasks since the first day of development.
Please feel free to test it in your environment.
But no guarantees.

## Project-based task management

𝑓𝑓 detects if it is run inside a **git** repository and saves notes in it.
Other VCS will be supported in future.
Feel free to open a ticket if you want to extend support.

### Get started

#### Personal

To save personal notes and tasks somewhere you must configure 𝑓𝑓's data
directory

    ff config dataDir --help

If you use Yandex.Disk, you can say just

    ff config dataDir -y

#### Project-based

To work with a project's tasks, just run 𝑓𝑓 inside a VCS repository.

    $ ls
    .git
    $ ff add ...
    $ ls
    .ff .git
    $ git add .ff

### Get some unfinished tasks

    $ ff
    Actual:
        * buy milk
          id 458a1456lrc-12z3opnykw, start 2018-01-10

### Add new task or note

    $ ff add 'learn Haskell'

Now you can find it in your agenda:

    $ ff
    Actual:
        * buy milk
          id 458a1456lrc-12z3opnykw, start 2018-01-10
        * learn Haskell
          id 459h2tqxutq-24nuhr86ae, start 2018-01-14

### Mark task done

Marking done is actually moving to archive.

    $ ff done 458a1456lrc-12z3opnykw
    archived:
        buy milk
        id 458a1456lrc-12z3opnykw, start 2018-01-10

Archived tasks don't appear in an agenda:

    $ ff
    Actual:
        * learn Haskell
          id 459h2tqxutq-24nuhr86ae, start 2018-01-14
